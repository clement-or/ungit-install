# Ungit Installer

If you're a programmer, [Ungit](https://github.com/FredrikNoren/ungit) is a wonderful tool for making non-programmers of your team collaborate on the project's repository. The problem is : to install it requires
**COMMAND LINES INSTRUCTIONS**, which might deter them. 
This tool automates the installation process and creates a desktop shortcut.

## Prerequisites

To work properly, Ungit requires Git, Node.js and npm. If you're in the future and this thing isn't updated, download [Git latest version](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js latest version](https://nodejs.org/en/).
Then, move them inside the script's folder and rename them respectively git.exe and node.msi.

Current versions are :
* Git 2.26.0 
* Node 12.16.1 LTS (npm is included)


## Installing

1. Download from here and extract into a folder
2. Run ungit-install.bat
3. Go through Git installation program
4. Go through Node installation program
5. Make sure both are added to PATH variable
6. Ungit is installed !
